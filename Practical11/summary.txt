the identical distance of SOD2_human (NP_000627.2) and RandomSeq is : 12
the percentage is : 5.405405405405405%
the identical distance of SOD2_mouse (NP_038699.2) and RandomSeq is : 13
the percentage is : 5.8558558558558556%
the identical distance of SOD2_human (NP_000627.2) and SOD2_mouse (NP_038699.2) is : 199
the percentage is : 89.63963963963964%

explaination:
The mouse and the human protein have a strong degree of similarity
while the random seq do not have strong similarity with mouse or human.
It could be deduced that the protein SOD2 may responsible for some neccessary activities in mouse and human.
Also, since mouse and human are all mammals it can be infered that the difference between mouse and human SOD2 protein did not influence the protein's core function
With the strong similarity, we may also conclude that the mouse and the human may dived from same ancestor
